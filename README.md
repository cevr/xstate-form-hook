## A custom form hook using xstate

Ensure you have dependencies installed!

```bash
yarn
```

To run:

```bash
yarn start
```

To run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

This is to demonstrate how to make a custom form hook with [xstate](https://xstate.js.org/docs/) using [xsfp](https://github.com/cevr/xsfp).

Also shows how to mock frontend requests while developing (and testing) using [msw](https://mswjs.io/)!
